# regatta
A simple sailing race scoring program

This program is just begining its development, so don't expect a working version any time soon.

The main goal of this project is to learn about the state of the art development tools and workflows while still producing something usefull.

This means especially using the following:

* Distributed version control (GitHub.com)
* Code review (GerritHub.io)
* Continues integration (Travis-CI)
* Test coverage (Coveralls.io)
* Planing and issue tracking (JIRA Software)
* Documentation (JIRA Confluence)
